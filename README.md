## Data Analysis
### 1. What can you learn from the highest rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences have an effect on ratings?

Analysis reveals that restaurants with higher ratings have a broader appeal, attracting both married and single customers. Conversely, lower-rated restaurants predominantly cater to single customers. This observation underscores the significance for lower-rated establishments to prioritize the development of strategies aimed at attracting a diverse customer base. By effectively engaging both single and married customers, these restaurants can enhance their ratings and achieve improved business success.

### 2. What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample?

San luis potosi surpasses all other states in terms of the highest number of consumers, closely followed by Marelos. This substantial consumer base in San luis potosi greatly contributes to the proliferation of restaurants and the generation of ratings when compared to other states.

### 3. Are there any demand & supply gaps that you can exploit in the market?

According to our analysis, it was found that 7.97% of the 138 surveyed customers prefer American dishes. In contrast, only 3.85% of the 130 restaurants surveyed actually offer American cuisine. These findings indicate a potential business opportunity for restaurants, as American cuisine ranks as the second most preferred option among customers.

To capitalize on this opportunity, it is recommended that more restaurants consider adding American dishes to their menus. By doing so, they can cater to the demand of customers who are seeking American cuisine and potentially increase their customer base.

### 4. If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?

The city of San has emerged as the leader with the highest number of restaurants and customers, closely followed by Moterio. However, San appears to be saturated in terms of restaurant offerings, making Moterio an attractive state for potential investment. There are several factors that make Moterio a promising location, such as a larger student population and a considerable number of employed individuals who have shown a preference for Mexican cuisine. Additionally, a notable proportion of the employed population has expressed a preference for Contemporary cuisine, while students tend to favor pizzerias.

Considering these factors, investing in a restaurant specializing in Mexican cuisine in Moterio could yield positive results. The student population and the presence of employed individuals seeking a taste of home can contribute to a steady customer base. Furthermore, incorporating Contemporary cuisine options could attract additional customers from the employed demographic. By carefully catering to these preferences, investors have the potential to thrive in Moterio's culinary market.
